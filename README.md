### Notes
- By default 2 different locations are chosen.
- If same locations are chosen, an error dialogue appears.
- To check which location is better, press the **Decide** button.
- Green means better, yellow means both are equally good.

### Logic
I use a scoring basis, i.e each property i.e proximity to location, coffee shop, dog park nearby has a value,
the highest being 3 and lowest being 1. The location with the biggest score wins.
